## Project Details

### Development Environment
WordPress installation based on Bedrock for a modular and standardized structure.

### Package Management
Utilizing Composer for seamless installation of plugins, themes, and languages.
Plugins and themes from wordpress.org sourced from the WordPress Packagist repository.
Languages installed from the WordPress Language Packs Composer Repository.

### Sage Theme
Sage theme used as the foundation, with Acorn installed as a plugin.

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS intentionally omitted, unless its benefits significantly outweigh the drawbacks.

### Laravel Features
Leveraging Acorn for Laravel features such as Blade templates, Blade components, and View composers.

### Reproducibility
WordPress installation and main theme can be reproduced from the git repository using Composer and npm (or yarn).
Excluding dependencies from git, with committed lock-files for version consistency.

### Repository Structure
Bedrock/WordPress and the main theme coexist within a single git repository.

### Plugin Selection
Each WordPress plugin installed in this test project is carefully justified.
Discouraging the use of ready-made themes to mitigate security risks and potential future dependencies.

## Usage
